Who can take tomorrow?
Dip it in a dream
Separate the sorrow
And collect up all the cream?
...The candyman can cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
And the world tastes good cause the candyman thinks it should!

(From Roald Dahl’s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory)

“Like Candy” brings you to a world of pure imagination: we present a world of creations by super-duper artists.

Reminiscent of the song helmed by Gene Wilder, the works in the exhibition defy explanation in a space that serves as a platform for freedom and endless possibilities.

Candy appears in figures of speech to allude to delight and a little sweetness out of the mundane. That candy gives comfort may be linked to an entire history of how it masks the taste of bitter medicine, bringing comfort to broken bodies and spirits. The first candy-making machine was invented by a pharmacist to crank out medicated candy lozenges. Similarly, truth is a bitter medicine that we readily savor when coated.

Art’s aesthetic distance has a comparable effect. The form soothes and ameliorates, so that no matter the subject, the encounter with art enables a surge of sensuous pleasure.

Where sugar rush is linked to sensation, candy often figures in celebratory occasions and life events. It is also used for rewards or treats, infused with a vivid color palette that enables the human mind to visualize the benefits. In effect, candy plays an integral role whether as prop for interaction or emotional trigger. In thought it is simile, yet as object it acquires a social life.

The taste and smell of candy triggers deep-seated memories of youth and nostalgia, or fleeting moments of joy. We recall faces of loved ones and families -- those from our youth and those whom we have lost.

The phrase “like a kid in a candy store” signifies elation and excitement at having several options or resources. We are confronted with an array of choices and at times, face a conundrum: do we toil away unseen like the oompa loompas or bury our heads in the chocolate river? Or do we patiently wait to inherit a legacy? Candy can also be associated with guilty pleasures, over consumption, anxiety, and indulgence. Like Dahl’s magnum opus, the consumption of candy illustrated through the characters of the diegetic world served to illustrate gluttony, greed, rudeness, and other moral crises.

We are surrounded by gummies, lollipops, chewing gum, chocolate, and all varieties of sweets. Like a box of candy, we never know what we're going to get unless we draw closer. The taste of candy in a box can only be known when one bites into it and savors the taste.

“Like Candy” was chosen as the title of the inaugural exhibition of Super Duper Gallery to underscore the prevailing whimsical aesthetic reminiscent of an array of confectionery. It is guaranteed to be a delicious exhibit and Super Duper Gallery invites you to have an enormous bite and experience sensory bliss.
